# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

# - My main motivation for this project was to complete the prework for the UPenn coding bootcamp before it started. I wanted to finish it a week before class so I could have time to review again and prepare.
# - I built this project to both act as an intro to coding and to use as a study guide for the course itself. Git, VS, HTML, CSS, and JS are huge tools in the coding world and the more time spent with them, the better I'll understand them in not only this course, but in my career. 
# - The problem this project solved was addressing my totally new introduction to coding. Hopefully I will have a basis idea for when the class starts. 
# - I learned a lot! I learned the basics of github, VS code, HTML, CSS, and JS. Not only did I learn these hard skills as a developer, but also the soft ones, like user stories, collaboration, problem solving, and how to be a better student.

## Usage
The main usage of this application is to help new students at the UPenn Coding Bootcamp learn and get a hands on approach to coding. Each of the four sections has info on their respective topics to the intro modules; its a work in progress! I tried adding images but couldn't manage it. I even uploaded them to github!
